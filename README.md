# Device Automation and Control using ESP8266

### Introduction

In a world where technology is showcasing incessant development and advancements, people are trying to cope up with it. People are getting smart, and devices are getting smarter. The need of the hour is automation and Internet Of Things (IoT) is a foundation stone for this. IoT can basically be defined as interconnectivity for various devices and gadgets. Thus, IoT is slowly becoming an indispensable part of our lives.

This new wave of connectivity is going beyond laptops and smartphones, itâ€™s going towards connected cars, smart homes, connected wearables, smart cities and connected healthcare. So, in our project, we aim to connect and control devices within a network established by ESP8266.
